### Hi there! 👋

I'm a software developer who enjoys crafting clean, scalable solutions — from backend services to frontend interfaces.

- 💼 I professionally work with **Java**, **Spring Framework**, and **Angular** to build full-stack enterprise applications.  
- 🌱 Currently exploring **Go**, diving into backend concurrency and systems programming.  
- 💡 Passionate about **clean architecture**, **modular codebases**, and writing code that's easy to understand and maintain.  
- 🧰 Experienced in building REST APIs, integrating complex systems, and creating responsive UIs.
- 🛠️ Always experimenting with new tech through side projects, tools, and prototypes.
- 😄 Pronouns: **He/Him**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Work on a software product is never *truly* complete — there’s always something to improve or rethink.
